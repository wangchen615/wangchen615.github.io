<p>I am a Research Staff Member in <a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/labs/watson/index.shtml">IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center</a>. My research interests
  include cloud video streaming systems, container cloud systems, data driven cloud system management and control, with special focuses on system resilience and user experience.
  I am also passionate with building systems. I have experience of working on video retrieval systems,
  video streaming systems, machine learning applications, big data analytics, production cloud systems (Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, AWS, Rackspace, IBM Cloud),
  and container cloud related open source projects (Kubernetes). Before
that, I received Ph.D. and M.S. in <a href="https://www.ece.cmu.edu/">Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> from
    <a href="https://www.cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon University.</a>  </p>
